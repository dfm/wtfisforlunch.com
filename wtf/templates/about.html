    It tells you where to go for lunch by mixing your current location and
    your past choices up in a pot and adding some magic. The data comes from
    the <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> API (which is awesome)
    and not from an evil company who's name rhymes with "kelp".
    </p>

    <p>
    This service <i>doesn't make recommendations</i>. Instead, it makes
    <i>decisions</i>. This is great because making decisions sucks.

    Did I mention that it's
    <a href="https://github.com/dfm/wtfisforlunch.com">open source</a>.
    Rock it.

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p><i>tl;dr</i> Magic.</p>

    <p>
    I have come up with (translation: pulled out of my ass) a parametric model
    for the likelihood that you'll accept a suggestion that I present to you.
    Assuming some simple priors, I can invert this likelihood function (using
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayes</a>) and draw
    "representative" restaurants from a distribution over distance, rating and
    price from the Foursquare API. In practice, this sampling isn't actually
    very rigorous. In fact, it's really
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge">kludgey</a> as fuck but we
    do what we can :-).
    </p>

    <p>
    This parametric model of the likelihood function has a few parameters
    (duh!) and these can obviously be different for different users. Every
    time you say yes or no, or rate a restaurant that you went to, this says
    something about your preferences. In practice, each response that you make
    should take
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">a
    gradient descent step</a> in the parameter space. This isn't actually live
    yet but <a href="https://github.com/dfm/wtfisforlunch.com">the code</a> is
    just about finished.
